On the solution of the course, Dr Angela decided to display some of the information using a loop inside index.ejs

On this new branch I wanted to keep the least amount of javascript out from the html document, so I implemented the solution on the index.js avoiding adding more js code into the HTML document. 

I'm yet to find a way of adding a jump line on the solution so the toppings can be displayed as a list.
